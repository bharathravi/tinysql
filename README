Database Systems Implementation Course Project
----------------------------------------------
Authors: Bharath Ravi, Benton Harris, Ishan Lal, Ashwin Kumble

COMPILING THE CODE
-------------------
The code uses Apache Ant to compile.
Please install 'ant' and simply run 'ant' from this directory to 
compile the code.


RUNNING THE CODE
-----------------
The main executable is tinySQL.jar
Using this, one may run any of the test classes under the 
examples directory.


In-Memory test cases 
----------------------
To Run our In-Memory test cases, run (from this directory):

   java -cp tinySQL.jar TestInMemoryText

This will launch an In-Memrory database, create a 'Cars' table,
and run some queries on it, as described in our Project Report.


Primary Key test cases
-------------------------
To Run our Primary Key test cases, run (from this directory):

   java -cp tinySQL.jar TestTextPrimKey 

   java -cp tinySQL.jar TestInMemoryTextPrimKey 
  
These will launch and run our Primary key test cases, as
described in our report.

For more information, details of test cases and/or implementation
please refer to our full-length Project Report.

Thank you!
